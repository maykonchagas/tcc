\begin{abstract}
The availability of accessible services and applications on the Internet has complicated the management of identities, both for users and system administrators. To go around this, the federated identity model aims to improve the access to services. However the implementation of a federation is not trivial, and, for many researchers who are developing studies on this field, deploying a federation to conduct practical experiments is a long and costly task. This paper aims to implement and provide a virtual environment for researchers to conduct experiments in a framework-based Shibboleth federation. All the proposed objectives were executed, resulting in an academic federation for experimentation using Shibboleth framework that allows development and experiments of technologies in federated identity management. The results are pre-configured virtual machines with a full federation that can be performed locally or elements of a federation for membership in the federation for experimentation developed in this work.
